# Effects for Construct 3

These are a bunch WebGL shader effects for use with [Construct 3](https://www.construct.net/). Most of them converted from old Construct 2 effects I was using. If you spot an error, want to add another effect to this collection or know of a better solution, please [submit a pull request](../../pulls).

## Known Issues:

* dropshadow and separatechannel won't scale correctly.

## Todo:

* add a blur option to drop shadow
* basically any effect made by scirra forum user *Somebody*
* lottes crt
* crt by anata
* vhs
* alphadither
* mode7
* any halfway decent ascii shader
