# Effects for Construct 3

These are a bunch of Construct 2 effects I converted for myself to use with Construct 3. If you spot an error, want to add another effect to this collection or know of a better solution, please submit a pull request.

## Known Issues:

dropshadow and separatechannel won't scale correctly.

## Todo:

* basically any effect made by *Somebody*
* lottes crt
* crt by anata
* gradient plus
* vhs
* adjust hsl
* alphadither
* mode7
* any halfway decent ascii shader
